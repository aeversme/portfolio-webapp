# Portfolio Webapp

**A #100DaysOfCode Portfolio Project**

<hr>

This is a work in progress. I will be creating a webapp from scratch to serve as my portfolio. The frontend will use 
the Bootstrap CSS framework, while the backend will be built with the Flask Python framework. I decided against finding 
and using a pre-made template for authenticity and simplicity.
