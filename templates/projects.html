                <h5>A Flask web application with Bootstrap CSS</h5>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>Flask, SQLAlchemy, smtplib, Werkzeug</li>
                        <li>HTML, Bootstrap CSS</li>
                        <li>Git, GitHub, Github Actions</li>
                        <li>Amazon Web Services, AWS Elastic Beanstalk</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>This webapp was created as a capstone project for the Python Bootcamp taught by Angela Yu of The App
                    Brewery. Some of the backend Flask code was written by me for an earlier project, while the frontend
                    code is almost exclusively written from scratch. It is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk via
                    GitHub.</p>
                <p>I am particularly pleased with two aspects of this application: styling the HTML with Bootstrap, a
                    framework with which I had little experience; and figuring out the deployment process, which
                    included using the AWS EB CLI tool locally, associating the application with a MySQL RDS instance,
                    and setting up a GitHub CI/CD pipeline to automatically push changes to Elastic Beanstalk.</p>
                <p>Numerous challenges presented themselves throughout the development process. Some examples:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Proper form validation: I decided not to use wtf.quick_form() to create the various HTML
                            forms, so the validate_on_submit() method was invalid. Documentation led me to an alternate
                            method for validating form fields.</li>
                        <li>Custom CSS: I wanted to define my own color for the Bootstrap buttons, but importing the
                            Bootstrap CSS via a CDN meant that I had no easy way to manipulate built-in values. A good
                            deal of searching led me to the code I needed to calculate color hex values and create my
                            own btn-custom class.</li>
                        <li>SMTP: my web application was unable to send emails (from the Contact page) after being
                            deployed onto AWS. A trip into my EB environment's EC2 logs first revealed a CSRF error, so
                            I explicitly imported CSRFProtect from Flask-WTF. Although that hurdle was cleared, POST
                            requests continued to time out. Several searches on stackoverflow eventually revealed that
                            AWS throttles outbound EC2 traffic on port 25. Explicitly defining a different port for
                            SMTP traffic has restored email functionality.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Future improvements may include: reCAPTCHA (or reCAPTCHA-like) bot mitigation; defining Elastic
                    Beanstalk configuration settings with code, instead of manipulating the EB environment in the AWS
                    console; improved blog formatting and pagination; more error-handling; some sort of alert (email?)
                    system when users comment on a blog post.</p>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>I completed this project shortly after obtaining the AWS Solutions Architect Associate
                    certification and just before I began an online bootcamp to learn Python. As I didn't know much
                    code at that point, I chose to use a pre-built HTML/CSS template for the frontend. Loading the
                    website triggers an AWS Lambda function that increases the visitor count in a DynamoDB table by one
                    and returns the new count to the website.</p>
                <p>This project contained many firsts for me, including implementation of a CI/CD pipeline, use of the
                    Serverless Application Model CLI tool, and creation of an AWS Lambda function. I spent numerous
                    research hours online as I worked towards completion of the website and its backend counter. I
                    attempted to write the Lambda code myself, but ended up referencing several other similar functions
                    to piece together a working solution.</p>
                <p>Since the completion of this project, I have learned quite a bit more about coding and about the way
                    these services function and work together. It would be an interesting exercise to see if I could
                    author the Lambda function on my own at this point.</p>

                <h5>An API-based Python GUI app</h5>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>guizero, tkinter, requests</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>After working with the <a href="https://pixe.la/" target="_blank">Pixe.la</a> APIs through the
                    console during a bootcamp project, I decided to create a graphical user interface application that
                    would allow me to track my time spent coding and learning on a pixel graph. I reused the
                    API-related code that I had authored during the bootcamp project and built the GUI from scratch.</p>
                <p>This was my first coding side project, written over the course of a week as I moved on to other
                    Python lessons. I am particularly pleased with my implementation of guizero, a wrapper for tkinter
                    that I had not used before. I relied heavily on the guizero documentation for reference.</p>
                <p>Some notable challenges:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Image resizing: I wanted to include the Pixe.la logo as part of the app's header, but when
                            I defined the desired width and height of the image, only a small corner of the full image
                            was shown in the app window. Some searching led me to discover that guizero required the
                            Pillow library to scale images. Installing the Pillow package created the desired
                            outcome.</li>
                        <li>Error handling: the Pixe.la API requires the 'date' header to follow a specific format, so
                            I needed to both convert the date string entered into the app, and catch other errors
                            before data was passed to the API. I learned how to use a try/except block to catch invalid
                            entries, and used the datetime module and strftime to convert the date entry into an
                            appropriate date object.</li>
                        <li>GUI operation: I wanted the app to have a reset button to clear text boxes and reset radio
                            button selections. Research revealed that guizero did not include wrappers for this type of
                            functionality, but that I could use tkinter methods with guizero to solve this challenge.
                            In the case of resetting radio buttons, this involved creating a list of the options and
                            calling tk.select() on the desired list index.</li>
                        <li>Including the graph: Pixe.la graphs are rendered in SVG format in a browser window. I
                            attempted to figure out how to display a graph in the GUI window, only to discover that
                            there doesn't seem to be a Python library that can handle SVG code effectively without
                            relying upon a separate image processing application. I did not like the idea of having to
                            include a separate program with this app, so I settled for a button that opens a link to
                            the selected graph in a new browser tab.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>For the time being, this application is complete. Future improvements may include: creating an
                    executable using PyInstaller; adding the ability to register new users and create new graphs;
                    displaying a graph in the app window if a library for doing so becomes available.</p>
